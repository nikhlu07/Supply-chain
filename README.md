A decentralized, blockchain-powered supply chain management system that ensures end-to-end transparency, traceability, and security from manufacturer to end customer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìñ Overview

Traditional supply chain systems suffer from fragmentation, lack of transparency, and vulnerability to fraud, leading to inefficiencies and loss of trust. It leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized supply chain management platform that:

* Records every transaction in a tamper-proof, transparent ledger.
* Provides real-time product provenance and ownership history.
* Integrates multimedia assets (images & videos) via IPFS and Livepeer for rich traceability.
* Protects against counterfeiting using non-duplicable "Secure QR" codes.

By tokenizing products as NFTs on Polygon, stakeholders can seamlessly transfer ownership, view event history, and authenticate authenticity with a simple QR code scan.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Product Minting**: Manufacturers register products (title, description, images, videos) and mint an NFT with embedded metadata.
* **Live Video Tracking**: Upload and stream supply chain videos using Livepeer, with metadata stored on IPFS.
* **Transparent Transfers**: Ownership transfers recorded on-chain; each scan of the product‚Äôs QR code displays current and past owner data.
* **Secure QR Codes**: Prevent fraud with non-reproducible QR codes that lose data on reprinting.
* **Decentralized Auth**: Social login (Arcana + RainbowKit), email auth, and Polygon ID for secure interactions.
* **Scalable Backend**: Node.js + Express API with MongoDB (via Mongoose) for off-chain data storage and indexing.

## üèó Architecture

```
[Manufacturer] --> [Next.js Frontend] --> [Express.js API] --> [MongoDB Atlas]
                                     \                      
                                      \---> [Polygon Smart Contracts]
                                              |              
                                              v              
                                      [IPFS] & [Livepeer]
```

1. **Front-End** (Next.js + Redux Thunk + RainbowKit + Arcana)
2. **Back-End** (Node.js + Express + Mongoose)
3. **Blockchain Layer** (NFT & Product Registry on Polygon Mumbai)
4. **Storage & Media** (IPFS for metadata; Livepeer for video streaming)
